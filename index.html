    <p>
        - Punctuation marks are eliminated by applying regular expression "[^a-zA-Z']" to each word.<br>
        - Stopwords (such as the, a) are filtered out from the analysis. HashSet is used to store string values of stopwords
        as HashSet offers constant time performance for the basic operation: contains() which is used to identify stop words in the file while 
        reading it.<br>
        - Words from the text file are stored in a HashMap where the word is stored as a key and a number of occurences is stored as a value.<br>
        - Search on a HashMap is O(1), which allows to check if the next word from the file is already in a HashMap in constant time
        and if yes, increase the number of its occurences.<br>
        - Keys are not case sensitive.<br>
        - Word cloud is used as a visual technique to demostrate how often words are mentioned in the text. <br>
        - Data visualization is done with <a href="https://www.anychart.com/" target="_blank">AnyChart JavaScript charting library.</a>
